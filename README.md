# RayCast
A simple java simulation with raycasting functionality.

# What is raycasting?
When you are rendering an environmentment, you will always be presented with the problem of rendering unnecessary faces on your objects. 
Raycasting solves this issue by detecting all faces that are in view of the renderer and only rendering those faces. This increases performance 
and optimization.
